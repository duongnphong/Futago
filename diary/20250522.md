### 🗓️ **Dev Work Log – May 22, 2025**

#### 👨‍💻 Name: Phong

#### 🏢 Project: AI Diary Assistant (Web App)

#### 🕒 Hours Worked: 8h

---

### ✅ **Tasks Completed**

* 🔧 **Integrated DeepSeek model via Ollama**

  * Pulled and configured `deepseek-coder:1.3b-instruct`
  * Fixed incorrect model name bug causing empty responses
  * Implemented prompt injection with today’s date for contextual answers
  * Handled fallback logic for no diary entry found

* 🌐 **Flask Backend Updates**

  * Connected `/ask` route with `ask_deepseek()` logic
  * Ensured JSON response is clean and informative
  * Debugged JSON decoding issues with Ollama response

* 📁 **Refactored Prompt Logic**

  * Unified prompt template between Gemini and DeepSeek
  * Added diary context parsing (range and single date)

* 🧪 **Test Coverage**

  * Manual API testing using `curl` and Postman
  * Confirmed diary prompt accuracy and model responsiveness

---

### 🚧 **Issues Faced**

* Model mismatch (`deepseek:1.3b-instruct` vs `deepseek-coder:1.3b-instruct`)
* Ollama returns excessive metadata — needed to filter `response` only

---

### 🧠 **Learnings**

* Ollama model responses aren’t standardized — requires custom parsing
* Embedding context like date and logs improves model performance drastically

---

### 🔜 **Next Steps (Tomorrow)**

* Render formatted summary on the frontend
* Store query logs for review and feedback loop
* Evaluate other models (e.g., LLaMA3, Gemma) for summarization performance
