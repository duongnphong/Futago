Early Days
My background is Mechatronics Engineering, a area covered with mechanical, electrical and a tiny bit of Programming in which took me 4 years to finish. With that being said, the shift of my study toward Information Science, especially Artificial Intelligence, in my opinion was a big shift. The reason for my shift of focus is not easy to put into words. I have always in fascinated by the term Artificial Intelligence since I was smaller when that two words got mentioned on on of media platform, even though I had no idea what it is all about.
