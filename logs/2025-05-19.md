Continued the RAG project: combined all the data and chunked it, embedded it, and created a vector store. I also created a function to query the vector store and get the most relevant documents.
Finished reading the book "The Psychology of Money" by Morgan Housel.
Prepared for the presentation for the module "Data Science and Machine Learning" on Friday.
Finished the frontend for the RAG project.
